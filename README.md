A few days ago I found the Advent code event, a thirty-day event of resolving programming puzzles, I had never heard about this before, but after investigating the internet and YouTube I've noticed that it is a very popular event. On the other hand, I have been learning Rust for a couple of months, so I will solve each of these puzzles in the Rust language to put my knowledge into practice.

I make a list here to register each puzzle of past years and its links with my solution:
